Next-generation organic solar cells based on oligomer acceptors
Solution-processed organic solar cells (OSCs), consisting of carbon-based electron donor and acceptor materials, have shown great potential for large-area and low-cost solar panels.While non-fullerene monomer acceptors have advanced the development of OSCs during the past decade, there remains a gap between OSCs and mature inorganic solar cells in terms of their efficiencies.

Solution-processed organic solar cells (OSCs), consisting of carbon-based electron donor and acceptor materials, have shown great potential for large-area and low-cost solar panels. While non-fullerene monomer acceptors have advanced the development of OSCs during the past decade, there remains a gap between OSCs and mature inorganic solar cells in terms of their efficiencies.This project aims to bridge the gap by developing a new generation of OSCs using novel oligomers. This project is made possible by our recent breakthroughs in fundamental understanding of OSCs. At the core of this project is rational materials development, coupled with device physics and device engineering investigations. We will combine experimental investigations with theoretical calculations to understand the impacts of oligomer aggregations on their exciton lifetime and photoluminescence quantum yieldâ€”two parameters key to the performance of OSCs. The optimization of the device performance will be assisted by optical/electrical characterizations and simulations. This project will achieve a new paradigm for realizing high-efficiency OSCs, contributing to the energy transition, globally as well as locally in Sweden.In addition to addressing outstanding strategic research challenges, I also aim to consolidate my position as an already established scientist and research leader in the area of solution-processed energy materials and devices throughout this project.
