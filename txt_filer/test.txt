If you had asked U.S. public utilities and government officials in 1967 to predict how America would power its grid in 2025, most would have said “nuclear.” That year—the height of atomic-age optimism—U.S. utility companies ordered 50 nuclear reactors, followed by another 196 over the next seven years. Long before climate change registered in the public consciousness, America was on track to rely on nuclear for a majority of its cost-effective, carbon-free electricity.

But that vision never fully materialized. A high-profile incident at Three Mile Island and the disaster at Chernobyl shook public confidence, prompting new regulations and stalling the nuclear industry. At the same time, electricity demand slowed, and in the absence of viable alternatives, the industry turned back to coal and oil. Just as the U.S. had built out its heavy nuclear manufacturing capacity, projects were delayed or canceled.

The dream of a thriving nuclear economy and supply chain went dormant. Until now!
