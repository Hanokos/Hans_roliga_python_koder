We are proposing Prof. Cabrera-Trujillo from (UNAM) in Mexico for the Tage Erlander visiting professorship for 12 months starting Sep. 2026. He is a world leading expert in time-dependent processes in atomic and molecular systems which he applies to a wide range of areas such as collisions, charge transfer, energy loss and deposition in materials, quantum confined systems, ultra-cold matter waves, and computational physics. He will visit the laser spectroscopy group at University of Gothenburg led by Prof. Dag Hanstorp who is conducting experimental research in both fundamental and applied fields including negative ions, atomic and molecular collisions, and optical levitation. There are many overlapping interests between the two groups and the aim of the visit is to combine the expertise of one theoretical and experimental research group to improve the impact of their research efforts. Joint research efforts in the fields of negative ions, confined quantum systems and super-heavy elements will be conducted. Experimental work will be performed in Gothenburg and at the DESIREE storage ring in Stockholm. Prof. Cabrera-Trujillo will, in addition to the research, take part in undergraduate teaching, assist in supervision of master and Ph. D. students, and be involved in outreach activities. A summer school focusing on numerical methods in atomic physics will also be arranged. Prof. Cabrera-Trujillo will interact with several groups within Sweden and also in the baltic region.
